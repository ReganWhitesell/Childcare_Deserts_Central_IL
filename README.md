# Childcare_Deserts_Central_IL README
## Project Description
Need to add this: {Why did i create this project? what is it doing?}

## Accessing Data
The Illinois Department of Children and Family Services provides the locations of all childcare facilities licensed with the state: https://sunshine.dcfs.illinois.gov/Content/Licensing/Daycare/ProviderLookup.aspx. For this project, I pulled data for the following counties: Mason County, Tazwell County, and Woodford County.   

## How to Install and Run
In order to install and run this project, you will need Python and an API key with the Census Bureau. API key requests can be found here: https://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html. I continued the rest of the project in QGIS to map the data.
